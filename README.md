👋🏽 Hey, I’m Cyril Bassey
Full-Stack Developer | MERN Stack Enthusiast | Builder of Things That Make Life Easier

I’m the kind of person who sees a problem and instantly starts thinking of how to fix it. That’s how I got into coding—one small need led to one small app… and then I never stopped building. Now, I work mostly with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and I’m all about creating solutions that feel simple, useful, and human.

I enjoy taking big ideas and breaking them down into clean, working code. 

But I’m more than just code.

🌱 Outside the tech world...
I play the piano. Music is my way of resetting—it keeps me grounded.

I read anything that stretches my thinking—from dev blogs to biographies to random life musings.

I write too. If you’re into dev stories, raw thoughts, and life-in-tech reflections, check out my Medium page.

I have a soft spot for the human brain, I dream of becoming a neurosurgeon someday 🧠 (still working on that one 👨🏽‍⚕️).

I love meaningful conversations, shared laughs, and finding beauty in little things.

If you’re scrolling through my repos, you’ll probably find tools I built to scratch an itch, passion projects that kept me up at night, and some ideas I’m still shaping. I love learning, I love building, and I love connecting with people who are doing the same.

Thanks for dropping by.
Let’s connect, create, and keep things moving forward. 🚀
